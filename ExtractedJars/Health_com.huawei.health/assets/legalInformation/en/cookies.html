  Huawei collects information from your  visits to our Web sites to help us gather statistics about usage and  effectiveness, personalize your experience, and tailor our interactions with  you. We do so through the use of various technologies, including one called &quot;cookies&quot;.  A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may  then be stored on your computer as a tag that identifies your computer. While  cookies are often only used to measure Web site usage (such as number of  visitors and duration of visit) and effectiveness (such as topics visitors are  most interested in) and to allow for ease of navigation or use and, as such,  are not associated with any personal information, they are also used at times  to personalize a known visitor's experience to a Web site by being associated  with profile information or user preferences. Over time this information  provides valuable insight to help improve the user experience.<br /><br>
  Cookies are typically categorized as  &quot;session&quot; cookies or &quot;persistent&quot; cookies. Session cookies  help you navigate through the Web site efficiently, keeping track of your  progression from page to page so that you are not asked for information you  have already provided during the current visit. Session cookies are stored in  temporary memory and erased when the web browser is closed. Persistent cookies,  on the other hand, store user preferences for current and successive visits.  They are written on your device's hard disk, and are still valid when you  restart your browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your  choice of language and country location.<br /><br>
  While Huawei Web sites at this time do  not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as  &quot;do not track&quot; instructions, you can generally express your privacy  preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies though  your web browser. You can set your browser in most instances to notify you  before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept  it or not. You can also generally set your browser to turn off cookies.<br /><br>
  Some web browsers may let you enable a  &quot;do not track&quot; feature that sends signals to the websites you visit,  indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is  different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a &quot;do not  track&quot; feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no  industry standard for how companies should respond to &quot;do not track&quot;  signals, although one may develop in the future. We do not respond to &quot;do  not track&quot; signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will  describe how in this Privacy Statement. More information about &quot;do not  track&quot; is available at www.allaboutdnt.org.</p>
