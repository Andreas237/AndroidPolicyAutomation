            jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the
            exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or other

        <p><strong><strong>1. License.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>Subject to the terms of this EULA, iRobot grants to you a limited and
            nonexclusive license (without the right to sublicense) to execute one
            (1) copy of the Product Software, in executable object code form only,
            solely on the Product that you own or control and solely for use in
            conjunction with the Product for your personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>2. Restrictions.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>You agree not to, and you will not permit others to, (a) license,
            sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute, transmit, host, outsource,
            disclose or otherwise commercially exploit the Product Software or make
            the Product Software available to any third party, (b) copy or use the
            Product Software for any purpose other than as permitted in Section 1,
            (c) use any portion of the Product Software on any device or computer
            other than the Product that you own or control, (d) remove or alter any
            trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends,
            symbols or labels in the Product Software, (e) modify, make derivative
            works of, disassemble, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of
            the Product Software (except to the extent applicable laws specifically
            prohibit such restriction for interoperability purposes, in which case
            you agree to first contact iRobot and provide iRobot an opportunity to
            create such changes as are needed for interoperability purposes), or (f)
            use any software except for the Product Software on or in connection
            with the Product (except for the Site Services and Mobile Software)
            except to the extent required by applicable terms and conditions in
            connection with Open Source Software provided with the Product Software.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>3. Automatic Software Updates.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>The Product Software may cause the Product to automatically
            communicate with the iRobot’s servers to deliver the functionality
            described in the Product Guide, to record usage metrics and to collect
            personal information as described in the iRobot’s <a>Privacy Policy</a>.
            iRobot may from time to time develop patches, bug fixes, updates,
            upgrades and other modifications to improve or otherwise modify the
            performance of the Product Software and related services (“Updates”).
            These Updates may affect or erase data on your Product or change or
            reset settings on your Product. These Updates may be automatically
            installed without providing any additional notice or receiving any
            additional consent if you have connected your Product to the Internet.
            You consent to these automatic Updates. If you do not want these
            Updates, do not connect your Product to the Internet or to your Mobile
            Device. You acknowledge that you may be required to install Updates in
            order for the Product and Product Software to operate properly and to
            access all updated features of the Product Software. In certain
            circumstances you may be entitled to request removal or disabling of
            Updates (see contact information below); however, iRobot is not
            responsible for providing support to Products that do not contain
            updated Product Software. If we provide further notice or request
            further consent to an Update, the notice or consent may be received or
            provided by any permitted user of the Product or the Site Services. The
            user receiving the notice or providing consent is responsible for
            notifying all other users. Your continued use of the Product is your
            agreement to this EULA.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>4. Ownership.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>The Product Software and all worldwide copyrights, trade secrets, and
            other intellectual property rights therein are the exclusive property
            of iRobot and its licensors. iRobot and its licensors reserve all rights
            in and to the Product Software not expressly granted to you in this
            EULA. The Product Software (and all copies thereof) is licensed to you,
            not sold, under this EULA. There are no implied licenses in this EULA.
            All suggestions or feedback provided by you to iRobot with respect to
            the Product Software shall be iRobot’s property. iRobot may use, copy,
            modify, publish, or redistribute the submission and its contents for any
            purpose and in any way without any compensation to you. You also agree
            that iRobot does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas
            previously known to iRobot, developed by its employees, or obtained from
            other sources. </p>
        <p><strong><strong>5. Open Source.&nbsp; </strong></strong></p>
        <p>Certain items of software included with the Product Software are
            subject to “open source” or “free software” licenses (“Open Source
            Software”). Some of the Open Source Software is owned by third parties.
            The Open Source Software is not subject to the terms and conditions of
            this EULA. Instead, each item of Open Source Software is licensed under
            the terms of the end user license that accompanies such Open Source
            Software. Nothing in this EULA limits your rights under, or grants you
            rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable end
            user license for the Open Source Software. If required by any license
            for particular Open Source Software, iRobot makes such Open Source
            Software, and iRobot’s modifications to that Open Source Software,
            available by written request to iRobot at the email or mailing address
            listed below.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>6. Term and Termination.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>This EULA and the license granted hereunder are effective on the date
            you first use the Product Software or Product and shall continue for as
            long as you own the Product, unless this EULA is terminated under this
            section. iRobot may terminate this EULA at any time if you fail to
            comply with any term(s) hereof. You may terminate this EULA effective
            immediately upon written notice to iRobot. Upon termination of this
            EULA, the license granted hereunder will terminate and you must stop all
            use of the Product Software, but the terms of Sections 2 through 18
            (inclusive) will remain in effect, after any such termination.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>7. Warranty Disclaimer.</strong></strong></p>

            JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING QUEBEC, DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR

            APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE BELOW EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU. </p>
        <p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
            PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IROBOT PROVIDES THE PRODUCT SOFTWARE
            “AS-IS” AND DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS,

            THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS (IF ANY). THIS LIMITATION IS CUMULATIVE AND WILL NOT
            BE INCREASED BY THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE INCIDENT OR CLAIM.
            IROBOT DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY OF ANY KIND OF i IROBOT’S LICENSORS AND
            SUPPLIERS.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>9. Limitations of Product Software.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>The Product Software provides you information (“Product Information”)
            regarding the Products in your home. All Product Information is
            provided “as is” and “as available”. We cannot guarantee that it is
            correct or up to date.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>10. For U.S. Government End Users.</strong></strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p>If you are a U.S. Government employee or are using the Product
            Software on behalf of a U.S. Government entity, the Product Software is a
            “commercial item,” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (OCT
            1995), and more specifically is “commercial computer software” and
            “commercial computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in
            48 C.F.R. 12.212 (SEPT 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
            C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (JUNE 1995), the Product Software
            is provided to U.S. Government End Users only as a commercial end item
            and with only those rights as are granted to all other customers
            pursuant to the terms and conditions herein.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>11. Export Compliance.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>The Product Software and related technology are subject to U.S. and
            Canadian export control laws and may be subject to export or import
            regulations in other countries. You agree to strictly comply with all
            such laws and regulations and acknowledge that you have the
            responsibility to obtain authorization to export, re-export, or import
            the Product Software and related technology, as may be required. You
            will indemnify and hold iRobot Parties &nbsp;harmless from any and all
            claims, losses, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, costs and
            expenses (including legal fees and expenses) arising from or relating to
            any breach by you of your obligations under this section.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>12. Governing Law; Venue.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>The courts in some jurisdictions, including Quebec, will not apply
            Massachusetts law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of
            those jurisdictions, then where Massachusetts law is excluded from
            applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to
            these terms. Otherwise, you agree that this EULA, and any claim,
            dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief relating
            to this EULA, will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of
            Massachusetts, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles
            that require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction.
            Any action or proceeding relating to this EULA must be brought in a
            federal or state court located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts and
            each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such
            court in any such claim or dispute, except that iRobot may seek
            injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction to protect its
            intellectual property or Confidential Information.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>13. Assignment.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this EULA are
            assignable by you, and any such attempted assignment shall be void and
            without effect. </p>
        <p><strong><strong>14. Notices.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>Any notice to you may be provided by email to the address that you registered with iRobot. </p>
        <p><strong><strong>15. Severability.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>If any provision of this EULA is unenforceable, such provision will
            be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such
            provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the
            remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. </p>
        <p><strong><strong>16. Waiver.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>All waivers by iRobot will be effective only if in writing. Any
            waiver or failure by iRobot to enforce any provision of this EULA on one
            occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such
            provision on any other occasion. </p>
        <p><strong><strong>17. General.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>The Product Software is deemed irrevocably accepted upon your use of
            the Product Software or Product. iRobot will have no responsibility to
            provide maintenance or support services with respect to the Product
            Software. </p>
        <p>You acknowledge that the Product Software contains valuable trade
            secrets and proprietary information of iRobot, that any actual or
            threatened breach of Section 2 (Restrictions) of this EULA will
            constitute immediate, irreparable harm to iRobot for which monetary
            damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an
            appropriate remedy for such breach. </p>
        <p>The headings of Sections of this EULA are for convenience and are not to be used in interpreting this EULA. </p>
        <p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, no amendment to this
            EULA will be valid unless it is in writing hand-signed by the parties.</p>

Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (JUNE 1995), the Product Software is provided to U.S. Government End Users only as a commercial end item and with only those rights as are granted to all other customers pursuant to the terms and conditions herein.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>11. Export Compliance.</strong></strong></p>

        <p><strong><strong>12. Governing Law; Venue.</strong></strong></p>
        <p>The courts in some jurisdictions, including Quebec, will not apply Massachusetts law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those jurisdictions, then where Massachusetts law is excluded from applying, your country&rsquo;s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that this EULA, and any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief relating to this EULA, will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. Any action or proceeding relating to this EULA must be brought in a federal or state court located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such claim or dispute, except that iRobot may seek injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property or Confidential Information.</p>
        <p><strong><strong>13. Assignment.</strong></strong></p>

        <p>You acknowledge that the Product Software contains valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of iRobot, that any actual or threatened breach of Section 2 (Restrictions) of this EULA will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to iRobot for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach. </p>
